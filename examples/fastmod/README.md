# Fast Mod Example

This is just a direct implementation of the below referenced fastmod algorithm. Was my exploration into algorithms which
do not depend on sequential logic. Just set the `n` and `d` registers with desired numerators or denominators and the
`r` register will reflect the remainder. This can be used for divisibility as well simply by checking if the remainder
is 0 or not.

```bash
/workspace/fastmod # iverilog fastmod.vl
fastmod.vl:33: warning: Port 1 (n) of fastmod expects 16 bits, got 8.
fastmod.vl:33:        : Padding 8 high bits of the port.
fastmod.vl:33: warning: Port 2 (d) of fastmod expects 16 bits, got 8.
fastmod.vl:33:        : Padding 8 high bits of the port.
/workspace/fastmod # ./a.out
